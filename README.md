Fusion power is energy generated by nuclear fusion, or more broadly, the use of that power as an energy source. Fusion has a number of advantages over fission as a source of power, including reduced radioactivity, ample fuel supplies, and increased safety. However, controlled fusion has proven to be extremely difficult to produce in a practical manner. Research into fusion reactors began in the 1940s, but as of 2017, no design has produced positive net energy.
